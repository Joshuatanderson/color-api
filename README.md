Credit where credit is due: 
Inspiration for this post comes from the blog of Chen Hui Jing.  https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/is-your-browser-a-polyglot/#%F0%9F%92%BB

Mozilla also has a rather useful demo app which I borrowed from quite heavily.  Definitely check out their article on using the web speech API if you wish to make a similar project.
